# Locomotive Controllers

This page describes RCC Locomotive Controllers often called Decoders. 

RCC supports several types of controllers with different pros and cons. All of them are built out of just two components - the motherboard and the CPU. Yep, your decoder will have a motherboard, like a grown up computer. The good news about RCC design - all controllers are using the same motherboard. Once you decide to try RCC - go ahead and fabricate a couple boards. Here is a detailed instruction (). How cool is that! Youâ€™d build your own boards!

How much will this offset you? If you go with 5 boards fully assembled - about $60 plus shipping (say $20). So, it is about $16 per board. If you want to reduce the total price you may go with 2 boards assembled and 3 more empty ones. That would be $47 (+$20 for shipping).
