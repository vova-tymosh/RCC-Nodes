# Locomotive Decoder

This page describes how RCC Locomotive Decoder works and how to build one. 

RCC supports several types of decoders with different pros and cons. All of them are built out of just two components - the motherboard and the CPU. Yep, your decoder will have a motherboard, like a grown up computer. The good news about RCC design - all decoders are using the same motherboard. Once you decide to try RCC - go ahead and fabricate a couple boards. How cool is that! Youâ€™d build your own boards! Detailed instruction is in [fabrication](fabrication) folder.

Now you need to select the CPU. This is mostly driven by whay kind of Throttle you want to use.

## Simple WiThrottle

The best choise if you want to run just couple locomotives, usually one at a time and you want to keep everything super simple. 

How much will this offset you? Minimal order is 2 assembled boards and 3 empty ones. That would be $47 (plus shipping). If you go with 5 boards fully assembled - that would be $60 plus shipping (say $20). So, it is about $16 per board.
