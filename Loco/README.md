3. Click **Get Quote** and then **Uplolad Gerber**
5. Selecte the **Gerber_xx** file you donwloaded in the step 1
6. Most of the seting below as good they are. Only check the following:
    - **PCB Qty** - how many boards do you need (minimum is 5)
    - **PCB Color** - you may chose whatever you like more
    - **Mark on PCB** - if you don't want JLPCB to mark your board with their stuff, select **Remove Mark**
8. In the **PCB Assembly** row - click on the enable button. It may ask you about panelization. If you are asking for just couple boards - say **I don't need panelization**
9. Same as last time, most of the settings are ok, only check these:
    - **PCBA Qty** - home many boards you need to be assembled. If you only want to try on 1-2 locos go with minimum amount in step 6 (5 boards) and minimum amount here, whioch is 2. This means they will build 2 fully assembled mother boards for you and the rest 3 wouldn't have electornics on them. You can throw these 3 away.
    - **Tooling holes** - selecte **Added by Customer**
    - **Board Cleaning** - this is optional, if you like your boards to looks nicer - select **Yes**.
