# Locomotove controller

1. Download all 3 files from [fabrication](fabrication) folder above, 
2. Go to <link>
3. Click **Get Quote** and then **Uplolad Gerber**
5. Selecte the **Gerber_xx** file you donwloaded in the step 1
6. Most of the seting below as good they are. Only check the following:
    - **PCB Qty** - how many boards do you need (minimum is 5)
    - **PCB Color** - you may chose whatever you like more
    - **Mark on PCB** - if you don't want JLPCB to mark your board with their stuff, select **Remove Mark**
8. In the **PCB Assembly** row - click on the enable button. It may ask you about panelization. If you are asking for just couple boards - say **I don't need panelization**
9. Same as last time, most of the settings are ok, only check these:
    - **PCBA Qty** - home many boards you need to be assembled. If you only want to try on 1-2 locos go with minimum amount in step 6 (5 boards) and minimum amount here, whioch is 2. This means they will build 2 fully assembled mother boards for you and the rest 3 wouldn't have electornics on them. You can throw these 3 away.
    - **Tooling holes** - selecte **Added by Customer**
    - **Board Cleaning** - this is optional, if you like your boards to looks nicer - select **Yes**.
10. Click **Next**. It will show you how the PCB would look like. CLick **Next** again.
11. Now it asks you for 2 more files - select **BOM_xx** for the BOM one and **CPL_xx** for the CPL one.
12. You'll see the error message with the following text. This is normal, these are not real components but just pads. Say **Continue**.
    '''The below parts won't be assembled due to data missing.
X1,X2,X3,X4,U1,X5,X6,X7 designators don't exist in the BOM file.'''
13. Now you see the list of your components. If everything is still in stock all are checked in the last column.
    - If you, like me, don't want this screw terminal and prefer dupont connectors, unselect items J1 and J2
14. CLick **Next**, go to payment, select your shipping and boom! You've done it! The boards will arrive to your door soon.
15.
